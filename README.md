# CRYPTOGRAPHIC-ALGORITHM
In the provided code we have implemented encryption and decryption of a file using 2 pairs of keys between 2 users by verifying signatures and algorithm which was used consists of RSA and asymmetric Key pairs. Digital signatures were used for verification and hashese were used  to verify the integrity of the file and keys.
